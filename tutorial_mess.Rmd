## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
require(datasets)
chickwts
data("chickwts")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(chickwts$feed)
feeds <- table(chickwts$feed)
feeds
barplot(feeds[order(feeds, decreasing = TRUE)])
```


```{r}

data(lynx)
hist(lynx)
h<- hist(lynx, 
         breaks = 11,
        freq = FALSE,
        main = "Poop")
#If freq = FALSE, this will draw normal distribution

curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean(lynx), sd = sd(lynx)),
      col = "Thistle4",
      lwd = 2,
      add = TRUE)

```

```{r}
require("datasets")
data(cars)
cars
```

### Calculate Descriptives
```{r}
summary(cars$speed) #summary of one variable
summary(cars) #summary of entire table
#These are the numbers that define the boxplot.. So lets take a look at that.
boxplot.stats(cars$speed)
# conf = confidence intervals around the median
# out = outliers (which we have none in this data set)
# You can load the psych package for more statistics such as "skewness" and "trimming" aka top-coding.
#Ok, now we are moving on to inferential statistics.
```


### Inferential Statistics

```{r}
#single proportion: Hypothesis test and confidence interval
#The Washington Redsocks won 98 games out of 162. Did they do significantly better than 50%? (Nationals had a signifcantly better than 50% season)
prop.test(98, 162)
